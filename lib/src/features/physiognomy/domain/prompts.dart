// ‚Ä¢ Physiognomy
// 1. Overview
// Physiognomy refers to the face (appearance) that is revealed on the outside. It can also refer to fortune telling (Âç†) that uses the appearance to determine a person's personality and temperament.
// 2. Characteristics
// Physiognomy originated around the same time that civilization arose, and it is a form of fortune telling that has been systematized from the magic method and has been passed down to the present. It is commonly called physiognomy, and it has been known to the public for 2,000 years. It is commonly seen as a philosophy book, and there are famous modern physiognomists such as Shin Gi-won. It is known that famous physiognomists from ancient times include Gwan-ro and Heo-so, but according to records, Gwan-ro seems to have used fortune telling based on the Book of Changes and astronomy[1], and Heo-so is not a physiognomist.

// Even physiognomists recommend not to blindly believe in physiognomy[2] and to live your own life. This is also said in the physiognomy book 'Ma-ui Sang-beop' mentioned above, not in another book. "A good physiognomy is not as good as a healthy body, and a good body is not as good as a good mind. A good mind is better than a good physiognomy or a good body." [3] Reference article 2

// According to research results in anthropology, facial features are determined by the genes of ancestors, and one gene is selected from the genes of both parents, not the middle type. In other words, physiognomy is determined by genes, and the claim that this affects fate can be seen as meaning that certain genes cause certain personalities. In other words, it is a kind of eugenics.
// 3. Parts of physiognomy
// In physiognomy, the face is generally divided into three parts. Each of the three parts is symbolized by the forehead, nose, and chin. The forehead [4] is called the upper part (‰∏äÂÅú), the part starting from the eyebrows and centered around the nose and including the cheekbones is called the middle part (‰∏≠ÂÅú), and the lower part of the face starting from the philtrum and including the chin is called the lower part (‰∏ãÂÅú). These parts govern each part of life. And the upper part is said to determine fortune up to the age of 30, the middle part is said to determine fortune up to the age of 40, and the lower part is said to determine fortune from the age of 50 and beyond.
// 3.1. Head and Forehead
// In physiognomy, it is said that there is a parental palace on the forehead. This governs fortune in early life (up to the age of 30) and determines whether one will quickly succeed in life due to the virtue of one's parents.

// In general, if the parental palace is lying down, one will not receive any virtue from one's parents and will have to make one's own fortune. On the contrary, if the parental palace is standing up, one will receive virtue from one's parents and will be on the path to success early.

// However, even if the parental palace is not good, if other parts are good, one can succeed in one's early 20s. In particular, a clean forehead is considered very good in physiognomy. This is when there are no blemishes, blemishes, or protruding parts.

// There is also a palace of authority. If you look at high-ranking officials or politicians, there are many people with good foreheads.

// A thick forehead that looks like pig liver overturned and has a glossy shine is a good forehead. It is said that former President Kim Young-sam's forehead was like this.
// 3.2. Eyes/Eyebrows
// Generally, the eyes are said to be the place where you can see the rich and poor, so if the face is worth a thousand nyang, the eyes are worth nine hundred nyang, which is the highest score in physiognomy.[5]
// According to Shin Gi-won, everything except the eyes is seasoning.
// Dragon's eyes: Very good eyes that achieve great success in whatever they do. Very precious eyes. In the past, they were also called the emperor's eyes.
// Phoenix's eyes: The most precious eyes in physiognomy. Much better than dragon's eyes, they are also the eyes of ambitious people who can get whatever they want. Since these are very precious eyes, they are lucky eyes that bring wealth without any special effort and allow you to live a much better life than others.
// Cow's eyes
// Stork's eyes
// Four hundred eyes: Very bad eyes. Evil, only committing fraud, violence, and assault on parents.
// Sam Baek-an: Not as good as Sa Baek-an, but better. Since it is the eye of an ambitious person, it can achieve its goals. It is good if it goes into the entertainment industry. However, Sam Baek-an has a very high possibility of harming others or oneself even if it is not intended.
// Horse Eye: An eye that is unfortunate and will lose children, a wife, or a husband in the later years.
// Snake Eye: An extremely bad eye like Sa Baek-an or Sam Baek-an. It should go into the police or bodyguard field where the body moves.
// Crab Eye: An eye that has no respect for parents.
// Monkey Eye: A talented eye. It can cause mental illness.
// Mandarin Duck Eye
// Rabbit Eye: Similar to Dragon Eye.
// Chick Eye: Similar to Dragon Eye, it is easy to mistake it. It can receive a lot of attention like Dragon Eye. However, in some ways, it does not match the precious Dragon Eye.
// Dol-an: An eye with a protruding eyeball. Also called Roan. It has good observation, intuition, and understanding of things. However, they lack composure, patience, and perseverance, and they are impulsive, violent, and curious, so both men and women are sexually lewd. In the end, they appear as dead people.
// Ring-shaped eyes: Eyes that protrude roundly, showing the whites of the eyes above and below the pupils, and the upper and lower eyelids are shaped like rings, so they are called ring-shaped eyes. They are violent and aggressive, cruel, extremely selfish, materialistic, and extremely stubborn. Even as a joke, you can't say they have a good personality.
// Eyes with closed eyebrows and eyes. Eyes with narrow brow ridges. They have difficulty suppressing emotional changes, so they have a strong aggressive nature, are not virtuous, and have a strong competitive spirit that hates to lose.
// Ja-ung-an: Also known as one-eyed eyes. They are quick-witted and witty, but their appearance and inside are different and hypocritical.
// Staircase eyes: The height of the two eyes are different. Their personality is extreme.
// Do-hwa-an: Flirtatious eyes. The eyes are always wet and smiling, and the eyes often glance sideways. There is a red glow in the eyelids. See Dohwasal.

// Double eyelids
// Single eyelids
// Eyeldugi/Jeontaekgung: Related to children and love. If there is red energy and the other conditions are met, it is said that there is Dohwaki. That is, the arrow of the peach blossom.
// If the distance between the eyes is wide: The person has a broad mind and does not hold on to people who are going deep, and aims for distant places.
// If the distance between the eyes is narrow: The person is sensitive, worries, and easily impatient, and thinks of immediate benefits before distant ones, so the person has narrow views and cannot see great gains. And there are many fights between couples.
// 3.3. Nose
// This is the place in charge of wealth. It is said that if the nose is good, the probability of becoming rich increases, and even if the other parts are ugly, at least the person will not starve.

// However, to become very rich, the eyes must be good.[6]

// Generally, a good nose is one in which the nostrils are not visible, the bridge of the nose is not sunken and is connected to the eyebrows, the crown is plump, and the size of the ridge and the base are not small.
// Sangeun (Â±±Ê†π): This refers to the bridge of the nose right under the eyebrows. It is good if it is slightly higher or lower than the eyebrows, and it is bad if it is excessive, whether it is big or small. Middle root/Yeonsu, Susang
// Hagun/Jundu: Since it starts from the indang and ends, it is good if it is round, glossy, and somewhat plump.
// Nandae, Jeongwi: Refers to the nostrils next to the jundu. If there is a dot here, it is not good because it is considered as if there is a hole in the money bag.
// Nostrils/Nostrils: It is good if they are not visible from the front. This is because it is considered as if there is a hole in the money bag. A nose with nostrils visible from the front is called Angrobi.

// Lion nose: An extremely precious nose. However, success is a bit late, and fortune or luck is slightly lacking compared to Yongko.
// Arrow nose
// Garlic nose: If it is a good physiognomy, it is a nose that is very good for fortune.
// Monkey nose: There is a lot of jealousy
// 3.4. Mouth/Phinjung
// A mouth that looks like a four-lion (Âõõ) and has slightly upturned corners is a handsome mouth. If there is no scar on the philtrum, and the philtrum is straight and moderately long like a split bamboo, it is said to be a lucky sign that you will have many siblings and children.
// Yong-ip
// : In physiognomy, it is said that the Yong-ip is a face that is full of ugly thoughts in the head, but brings success and fortune. It is also said that if the complexion is full of scarlet lips, it adds to the luck. People with Yong-ip are forbidden from putting ugly thoughts in their heads into practice!! The appearance is said to be a gentle curve with the upper lip slightly turned upward and slightly thin scarlet lips. It is said that the main character of the Chu Han Dynasty, Liu Bang, is a dragon, and his lips were a strong scarlet color with the Yong-ip.
// Sa-ja (ÂõõÂ≠ó) mouth
// If the mouth is large, the complexion is pretty and scarlet, and the wrinkles and shape of the lips are well-organized, it is a lip that brings good luck and fortune, but if it is not and simply has large lips, it is the lip of the Sun-la-gun. A narrow upper and wide lower philtrum
// A flat philtrum
// A protruding mouth

// It is said that one's face is also judged by the number of teeth. In the law of physiognomy, the number of teeth is said to be the same as the number of teeth.
// If the number of teeth is 40, it means that one will be intelligent and noble like Sakyamuni, if it is 38, it means that one will be highly respected like Liu Bang of the Chohan Dynasty, if it is 36, it means that one will have a high position, if it is 32, it means that one will live a little more comfortably than the average person, if it is 30, it means that one will live an ordinary life, and if it is 28, it means that one will live a poor life.
// 3.5. Ears
// Your fortune when you are young is judged by your ears. In physiognomy, ears determine your fortune in early life (until the age of 15).
// 3.6. Moles
// There is a saying that there are no good spots on the face and no bad spots on the body.
// Of course, this is generally true. There are good spots on the face.

// Mole under the nose: Symbolizes losing one parent.
// Mole on the genitals: Very energetic.
// Mole just below the nostril: Acts as a treasure trove. Good fortune in money.
